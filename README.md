spatial-data-with-r
===================

These are the materials for my lecture on Spatial Data Analysis with R, in the Stanford course 
Stats 253, Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Data
taught by Dennis Sun, Stanford University, Summer 2014
http://web.stanford.edu/class/stats253

I'm a TA for the class and I'm giving a lecture to introduce spatial data analysis.
The lecture is prepared in knitr. The main script is main.Rnw, and the compiled pdf is main.pdf

Much of the material comes from the book
Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R, Roger S. Bivand, Edzer Pebesma and V. Gomez-Rubio
UseR! Series, Springer, 2nd ed. 2013.
   
Running this script requires that the code and data bundles from the book be unzipped in the same folder as the script. 
These data sets are present in the present git repository, and their original source is the book website:
